   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ams-interventions.git
   cd ams-interventions
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:

   - No server or build process required!

### Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings

   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/ams-interventions/`

## 📝 Adding New Interventions

### Step 1: Add to the Tier Page

Edit the appropriate tier page (`tier1.html`, `tier2.html`, or `tier3.html`) and add a new intervention card:

```html
<a href="interventions/tier1/your-intervention.html" class="intervention-card" data-tags="your-tags">
    <h3>📌 Your Intervention Name</h3>
    <div class="rating">★★★★☆</div>
    <p class="description">Brief description of the intervention.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Who this helps</p>
</a>
```

### Step 2: Create the Detail Page

1. Copy an existing intervention page as a template (e.g., `modeling.html`)
2. Rename it to your intervention name
3. Update the content following the template structure:
   - What It Is
   - Quality Implementation
   - Implementation Approaches
   - Step-by-Step Instructions
   - Common Pitfalls
   - Adaptations
   - Monitoring Success

### Step 3: Update Navigation

Ensure the navigation links in your new page point to the correct paths:
- `../../index.html` - Homepage
- `../../tier1.html` - Back to tier list
- `../../css/style.css` - Stylesheet
- `../../js/main.js` - JavaScript

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `css/style.css`:

```css
:root {
    --tier1-color: #4A90E2;  /* Blue for Tier 1 */
    --tier2-color: #F5A623;  /* Orange for Tier 2 */
    --tier3-color: #7ED321;  /* Green for Tier 3 */
    /* ... other colors ... */
}
```

### Adding New Features

The JavaScript file (`js/main.js`) includes:
- Search functionality
- Filter by tags
- Smooth scrolling
- Back-to-top button
- Print functionality

Add your own functions following the existing patterns.
